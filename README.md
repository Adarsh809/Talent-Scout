### Data Flow

1. **User Input** → Streamlit chat interface
2. **State Management** → Session state tracks conversation and candidate data
3. **Context Building** → System prompts + conversation history
4. **LLM Processing** → Groq API generates contextual responses
5. **State Update** → Candidate snapshot updated based on response
6. **UI Rendering** → Response displayed in chat + sidebar updated
7. **Data Persistence** → On conversation end, data saved to JSON

### Key Design Decisions

**1. Modular Architecture**
- Separating concerns (UI, LLM client, prompts, storage) makes the codebase maintainable and testable
- Each module has a single, well-defined responsibility

**2. Groq for LLM Inference**
- Chosen for exceptional speed (critical for real-time chat UX)
- Cost-effective compared to OpenAI GPT-4
- LLaMA 3.3 70B provides excellent quality-to-cost ratio

**3. Session State for Context**
- Streamlit's session state provides reliable state management across reruns
- Enables seamless multi-turn conversations
- Tracks both conversation history and candidate data snapshot

**4. JSON File Storage**
- Simple, file-based "database" suitable for prototype/assignment
- Easy to inspect and debug
- Timestamped records for audit trail
- Production version would use proper database (PostgreSQL, MongoDB)

**5. Explicit Field Labeling in Prompts**
- System prompt instructs model to use CAPS for field names (e.g., "What is your FULL NAME?")
- Enables simple regex-based field detection in `update_candidate_state_from_text()`
- Trade-off: simplicity vs. more sophisticated NLP-based extraction

## 🎨 Prompt Design

### System Prompt Strategy

The system prompt (in `prompt_builder.py`) serves as the foundation for all assistant behavior:

```python
BASE_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """
You are TalentScout, an AI hiring assistant chatbot for a tech recruitment agency.

Your goals:
1. Greet the candidate and explain you will collect basic details and ask tech questions.
2. Ask for these fields ONE BY ONE in this exact order, clearly labeling them:
   (a) Full Name
   (b) Email Address
   (c) Phone Number
   (d) Years of Experience
   (e) Desired Position(s)
   (f) Current Location
   (g) Tech Stack (languages, frameworks, databases, tools)
...
"""
```

### Prompt Engineering Techniques

**1. Role Definition**
- Clearly defines the assistant as "TalentScout" with specific purpose
- Sets professional tone and establishes expectations

**2. Structured Task Breakdown**
- Numbered goals provide clear hierarchy
- Sub-steps (a, b, c...) ensure systematic information gathering

**3. Explicit Field Labeling**
- Instructs model to include field names in CAPS
- Example: "What is your FULL NAME?"
- Enables downstream parsing and state management

**4. Sequential Processing**
- "ONE BY ONE" instruction prevents information overload
- Maintains natural conversation flow
- Allows for clarifications and follow-ups

**5. Context Injection**
- Dynamic context message shows what's been collected:
```python
def build_hiring_context_message(candidate_state: dict):
    """Add helper message describing collected info"""
    summary = "\n".join(f"{key}: {val}" for key, val in candidate_state.items() if val)
    helper = f"Here is the candidate information collected so far:\n{summary}\n..."
    return {"role": "system", "content": helper}
```
- Prevents redundant questions
- Guides model to ask for missing info or proceed to technical questions

**6. Behavioral Guardrails**
- "If input is off-topic, politely steer back"
- "Never ask for extremely sensitive data"
- Ensures focused, professional conversations

**7. Exit Handling**
- Explicit instructions for graceful conversation closure
- Detection of keywords: quit, exit, bye, goodbye, stop, end

### Technical Question Generation

Once tech stack is known, the system prompt instructs:
```
"Once you know the tech stack, generate 3-5 tailored technical questions
over the course of the conversation (not all at once)."
```

**Adaptive Questioning:**
- Questions tailored to specific technologies mentioned
- Example: Python + Django → questions about decorators, ORM, middleware
- Example: React + TypeScript → questions about hooks, type inference, state management

**Progressive Difficulty:**
- Model naturally varies difficulty based on years of experience
- Junior candidates get foundational questions
- Senior candidates get architecture and design questions

## 🚧 Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Context Management Across Turns

**Problem**: Streamlit reruns the entire script on each interaction, making stateful conversation difficult.

**Solution**: 
- Leveraged Streamlit's `st.session_state` to persist:
  - Conversation history (`messages`)
  - Candidate data snapshot (`candidate`)
  - Conversation status (`conversation_active`, `greeted`)
- Each message exchanged is appended to session state
- Full conversation history sent to LLM on each turn for context

### Challenge 2: Mapping User Responses to Specific Fields

**Problem**: Open-ended conversation makes it hard to know which field a user's response corresponds to.

**Solution**:
- System prompt instructs model to use explicit field labels (CAPS)
- `update_candidate_state_from_text()` function checks last assistant message for field keywords
- Simple pattern matching: if "full name" in question → store answer in "Full Name" field
- Trade-off accepted: works reliably for structured flow, may need NLP for more complex scenarios

### Challenge 3: Preventing Redundant Questions

**Problem**: Without proper context, LLM might re-ask already-answered questions.

**Solution**:
- Implemented `build_hiring_context_message()` that injects current candidate state into system context
- Before each LLM call, model sees summary of collected information
- Model intelligently skips already-filled fields and proceeds to next missing field

### Challenge 4: Graceful Exit Handling

**Problem**: Users expect to end conversation naturally, but need confirmation and data saving.

**Solution**:
- Implemented keyword detection (`contains_exit_keyword()`)
- When exit keyword detected:
  1. Send special system message to LLM for closing remarks
  2. Save candidate data to JSON
  3. Set `conversation_active = False`
  4. Display closure message and disable chat input
- User can refresh to start new session

### Challenge 5: Technical Question Quality

**Problem**: Generic technical questions aren't useful for assessment.

**Solution**:
- System prompt emphasizes: "generate 3-5 tailored technical questions based on the TECH STACK"
- Model naturally leverages its training on technical content
- Questions adapt to:
  - Specific technologies mentioned
  - Experience level (inferred from years of experience)
- Questions distributed across conversation (not all at once)

### Challenge 6: API Key Security

**Problem**: API keys shouldn't be hardcoded or committed to version control.

**Solution**:
- Used `python-dotenv` for environment variable management
- `.env` file stores `GROQ_API_KEY`
- `.gitignore` prevents `.env` from being committed
- `llm_client.py` reads key from environment with fallback error handling

### Challenge 7: UI/UX for Real-Time Updates

**Problem**: Users need to see what information has been collected.

**Solution**:
- Implemented sidebar display showing candidate snapshot
- Updates automatically after each interaction
- Shows "Not provided yet" for missing fields
- Provides transparency and reduces user confusion

## 📊 Data Privacy & Compliance

### Data Handling Practices

1. **Local Storage**: All candidate data stored locally in `candidate_data.json`
2. **No Cloud Database**: Avoids third-party data storage concerns
3. **Simulated Environment**: Uses anonymized/test data for development
4. **Timestamp Tracking**: Each record includes UTC timestamp for audit trail

### GDPR Considerations

- **Data Minimization**: Only collects necessary fields for hiring assessment
- **Purpose Limitation**: Data used solely for recruitment screening
- **Transparency**: Candidate informed of data collection purpose
- **No Sensitive Data**: Deliberately avoids SSN, government IDs, passwords, etc.

### Production Recommendations

For production deployment, implement:
- Encrypted database storage (e.g., PostgreSQL with encryption at rest)
- HTTPS for all communications
- User consent mechanisms
- Data retention policies
- Right to deletion (GDPR Article 17)
- Access controls and authentication
- Audit logging
